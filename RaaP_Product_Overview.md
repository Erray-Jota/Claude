## Key Features

### 1. **Real-Time Cost Estimation**
As you make design choices, costs update instantly. No waiting for quotes or estimates.

### 2. **Regional Cost Factors**
The system knows that building in San Francisco costs more than building in Phoenix. It automatically applies accurate regional multipliers.

### 3. **Intelligent Unit Optimization**
You set targets (e.g., 40 studios, 40 one-beds, 30 two-beds), and the system optimizes the actual mix to fit efficiently in your building dimensions.

### 4. **Visual Design Tools**
- See your building in 3D renderings
- View floor plans with unit layouts
- Watch walkthrough videos of the construction process

### 5. **Location-Based Intelligence**
Simply type a city name or zip code, and the system:
- Finds the exact location
- Calculates regional cost factors
- Determines the nearest factory
- Adjusts all estimates accordingly

### 6. **Comparison Analysis**
See side-by-side comparisons of:
- Site-built vs Modular costs
- Different unit mix scenarios
- Various building configurations

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: Alpine Vista Apartments

**The Project:**
- 100-unit apartment building in San Francisco
- Mix of studios, 1-beds, and 2-beds
- 5 stories tall

**The Process:**
1. **Enter Location** - "San Francisco, CA"
2. **Set Requirements** - 40 studios, 30 one-beds, 30 two-beds, 5 floors
3. **Review Design** - System optimizes to fit units efficiently
4. **Analyze Costs** - Instantly see:
   - Site-built cost: $25.5M
   - Modular cost: $22.9M
   - **Savings: $2.6M** (10%+)
   - **Time saved: 9 months**

**The Decision:**
Developer can immediately see that modular construction saves over $2.5 million and gets tenants in 9 months sooner (meaning 9 months of earlier rental income). This makes the decision clear and quantifiable.
